# Jrend
Jrend is a DOM lightweight rendering engine that was made to attempt to make it easier to render DOM elements. The main objective when creating this library was to provide an easy to use interface to create complex UI structures quickly without needing to learn an an extra templating language.

- Jrend works in a simple fashion: Javascript objects are transformed into DOM elements as you desire them to be.
